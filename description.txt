--- Power of Friendship ---
by GabeHasWon
commissioned & designed by Moxie

Power of Friendship adds many friends, in the form of the new Summoner subclass, Talismans.
Talismans allow you to conjure and control various objects, from Frosty the Iceman to Jerry Skelly to a copper shortsword.
These chase your mouse in various ways, each having their own little gimmick.
Talismans span throughout the game, with 20 talismans to use and enjoy.

Along with that, the mod adds a variety of accessories for whips and talismans, a few new armor sets for both, and more!

Finally, the mod adds Death herself. Kill a Prismatic Lacewing in a Graveyard to find your end, her grace, the Empress of Darkness.
Do be careful doing it in the Hallow, however. Who knows what would happen?
